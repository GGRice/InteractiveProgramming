# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

We plan to create a data visualization of presidential voter demographics. We want to look at gender, race, age, and year of voting. We want the user to decide the value of the previous variables using drop down menus and sliders for selecting the different values. For the MVP we plan to have a drop down list of gender, race, and year of voting. The next step will be to add a slider for age of voter. The stretch goal will be to also have a slider for year of voting instead of a drop down menu. We plan to generate a visualization of these different demographics. We are thinking of saying 1 “person” shown will count as 1000 people (or something like that). We plan to have blue (or some colour) people to show who voted and grey people to represent the rest of the populations. We are going to be deeply exploring interactive programming and GUI.

Gretchen Learning Goal: I want to learn more about using GUI. I haven’t really done much with that and it is still kind of just a questionable black box for me. 

Nina’s Learning Goal: I have never done interactive programming and therefore want to learn more about it.

We are not sure what libraries we will be using yet because neither of us have done interactive programming with Python. There is a library called Interactive which seems to be useful. The way we will discover libraries is by discovering which inputs and outputs we need and then searching for libraries that can generate these. Also, we will talk to NINJA's about libraries they know about. By the mid-project check-in we want to manually input the data for the visualization and for it to produce a visualization. Basically, our project without a GUI. Our biggest risks to being successful in this project is not accomplishing the work we want by the mid-project check-in.
