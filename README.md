# InteractiveProgramming
This is the base repo for the interactive programming project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

We plan to create a game that is like a mix of Pong and Air Hockey. We want it to be an interactive game for two people with each person controlling a paddle of sorts. The players will try to keep a ball/puck from getting past them. Depending on where on the paddle the ball hits will determine where the ball will bounce to. The goal is to score points by getting the ball past the other player. We were thinking the game could go to a certain score and then start over again. We will be exploring a lot of GUI and interaction between keyboard and what is happening on screen. Our MVP will be a game that doesn’t keep score and just allows one game, so when the ball is scored the game doesn’t continue. The stretch goal is that have a game that keeps score (and show the score) and you can continue to play. 

Gretchen Learning Goal: I want to learn more about using GUI. I haven’t really done much with that and it is still kind of just a questionable black box for me. 

Nina’s Learning Goal: I have never done interactive programming and therefore want to learn more about it.

We plan to use the pygame library because there is a lot of documentation about how to use it. It is also a library specific for making games. For the mid-project check-in we hope to have a plan of all the functions we need as well as have looked at what in pygame will help us. The biggest risk to being successful on this project is if we can not get pygame to work. Another big risk is that we are starting a little later than we planned so we hope we aren’t biting off more than we can chew, at this point.
